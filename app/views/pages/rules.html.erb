			<h2>OFFICIAL RULES</h2>
			<p>
				These are the official rules of the tipping competitions. We have tried to write them in legalese so that nobody can actually understand them. Please email us at ***** if you have any questions. Any questions you submit might end up on an FAQ. That is we get asked any questions and they become frequent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A <b>Competition</b> is a tipping competition.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <b>Race</b> is a cycling race on which a tipping competition is based. A Race consists of one or more <b>Stages</b>. For example, Milan San Remo would be a one-Stage Race. Giro del Trentino is a five-Stage Race.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Riders</b> participate in Races. They are (usually) professional cyclists.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tippers</b> participate in tipping competitions. There are no rules preventing Riders from becoming Tippers. There are rules of nature that probably prevent most Tippers from becoming Riders (we know this because we’re not Riders).
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Each Competition mirrors the timing and results of the underlying Race. Each Tipper nominates a Rider for each Stage of the Race. The Tipper gains the selected Rider’s time (including any bonus seconds), sprint points and KOM points. After any given Stage, the Tipper with the lowest cumulative time is the GC leader. The Tipper with the most sprint/KOM points is the sprint/KOM leader.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each Tipper may only select each Rider once during the Competition. So if you use Richard Virenque on the Prologue TT, you will not have him in the hills. Conversely, if you wait to use Stu O’Grady until after he crashes, you will not get to use him. Unsurprisingly, this is the hardest part of the competition.
				</li>
				<li>
					Many Tippers can select the same Rider for a given Stage.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is a Default List of riders for each Race. This List will be available on the Competition page prior to the start of the Race. The Default list provides a default Rider for Tippers who:
					<ol class="style-alpha">
						<li>
							Fail to enter a tip before the deadline;
						</li>
						<li>
							Tip a Rider who DNS; or
						</li>
						<li>
							Tip a Rider who DNF.
						</li>
					</ol>
					Note that the Default List is set at the beginning of a Race and does not change. The Default List is determined by the UCI WorldTour ranking prior to the start of a Race. If the Race is the first of the season ie Tour Down Under, then the Final UCI WorldTour rankings from the year prior will be used.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Default Tipping Mechanism works as follows:
					<ol class="style-alpha">
					 	<li>
					 		When the stage starts, any Tipper who has failed to enter a tip is flagged as requiring a default.
					 	</li>
					 	<li>
					 		When results are uploaded, any DNS or DNF Riders are removed from the Race (and from the Default List). Any Tipper who had selected a DNS or a DNF is flagged as requiring a Default.
					 	</li>
					 	<li>
					 		Each Tipper who has been flagged is given the Rider on the top of his/her Default List.
					 	</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Note that each Tipper’s Default List is unique as it does not contain Riders that have been tipped on earlier Stages.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Default Tipping Mechanism does not respect that you might have tipped a Rider on a future Stage. It does, however, realise the damage it is doing and will email you to tell you have used a Default Rider. In fact, the DTM will actually remove your future tip if it brings it forward.
					</p>
					<p>
						Default tipping is much easier to understand using examples. For all of these examples, we will be tipping a three Stage Race.
					</p>
					<b>Default List:</b>
					<ol class="list-no-margin">
						<li>Hinault</li>
						<li>Merckx</li>
						<li>Virenque</li>
						<li>Fignon</li>
						<li>Sean Kelly</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Default Tipping Example 1</b>
					<ul>
						<li>On Stage 1, Woody tips Hinault.</li>
						<li>On Stage 2, Woody forgets to tip. He is assigned Merckx as his default since he has used Hinault.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Default Tipping Example 2</b>
					<ul>
						<li>On Stage 1, Woody tips Hinault. During the Stage, Merckx crashes out of the Race.</li>
						<li>On Stage 2, Woody forgets to tip. He is now assigned Virenque as his default since he has used Hinault and Merckx is no longer racing.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Default Tipping Example 3</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Before the start of Stage 1, Woody enters tips Hinault, Sean Kelly and Merckx for Stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sean Kelly crashes out on Stage 1.
						</li>
						<li>
							On Stage 2, Woody forgets to update his tip (recall, Sean Kelly has crashed out). He is assigned Merckx as his default since he has used Hinault. Even though he has entered Merckx for Stage 3, Merckx is still the top rider on his Default List. Merckx is removed as his tip for Stage 3.
						</li>
						<li>
							On Stage 3, Woody again forgets to update his tip (recall, his set-and-forget Merckx tip was deleted after Stage 2). Now he is given Virenque who is the top rider on his Default List.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					For a TTT,you select an individual Rider as normal. You are allocated the Rider time, not the Team time. Therefore, if your Rider gets dropped from the team they will receive a different time from the team. This time is  calculated by subtracting GC before the TTT from GC after the TTT. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Results are uploaded by hand. Occasionally we make mistakes. Please forgive us. We source results from the Race’s official site whenever possible. If the Race website is useless we use another source. We are open to criticism and love a good chat about how we could do something better or simply just do it right. Get in <a href="mailto:cyclingtipping@gmail.com">touch</a> with us!
				</li>
				<li>
					Last rule. No more rules (until someone smarter than us works out some loophole).
				</li>
