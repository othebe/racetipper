			<h2>VeloTipper terms and conditions</h2>
			<h4>Privacy</h4>

			<p>We will retain your email address until you elect to disable your account at which point we will flush it down the figurative bogger. While we have your email, we will occasionally send you updated and reminders about tipping competitions. These could include reminders to tip, notifications of competition invites or if you tip particularly badly and we feel the need to rub it in.</p>

			<p>We will not sell your email address, nor will we provide it to third parties. We will make reasonable efforts to not have VeloTipper compromised by various hackers, but our electronic fighting skills peaked with Street Fighter II.</p>

			<p>If you have joined a competition that is hosted on another site (for example, <a href="http://www.cyclingtips.com.au">CyclingTips</a>), we will not retain your email address in our db. At the conclusion of the competition, we may provide a copy of the tipping data to the site on which it was embedded for archival purposes. We believe it is important to retain an accurate record of who has beaten who.</p>

			<h4>Errors</h4>

			<p>We will make the occasional error. Please <a href="mailto:velotipper@gmail.com">contact us</a> and we will endeavour to correct it as quickly as possible. We apologise in advance, and will offer to you a full refund of all monies that you have paid to us (aka, nothing) should you suffer any monetary losses. If you choose to wager on your own competition, good luck. Any wagers are undertaken at your own risk and VeloTipper has nothing to do with it.</p>

			<h4>Note</h4>

			<p>This document has been produced without regard to legalese and describes our intent. I highly doubt it will mean anything in any court of law. Well, it will probably mean whatever the highest paid wig-wearer construes it to mean.</p>
